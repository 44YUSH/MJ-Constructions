                    <div class="founder-text">
                        <p>A young man stood at the crossroads of life with nothing but dreams in his heart and determination in his soul. Born in a modest family in Sambalpur, Odisha, He had no wealth, no support, and no experience but only an unshakable belief that hard work could change his destiny.</p>
                        <p>Life was not kind to him in the beginning. With no financial backing, he started from scratch, taking up small job to make ends meet. He worked tirelessly, saving every rupees he could. The days were long, the nights were restless, and hunger was often his companion. But he never let his struggles break his spirit. In those tough times, he saw an opportunity in a small cycle repair shop. With minimal investment and sheer determination, he set up his own cycle store. It was not an easy journey but he had to work day and night, facing rejection, financial pressure, and the struggle to gain customers.</p>
                        <p>He knew that survival was not enough, he wanted to build something bigger. With years of experience in handling small businesses and saving whatever he could, he took a bold step into the construction industry. In the early 2000s, he laid the foundation for Maa Jhadeswari Constructions, named after his devotion to the Goddess Jhadeswari.</p>
                        <p>Starting with small projects, he proved his worth through hard work and honesty. His reputation grew, and with time, his company bagged larger contracts in Odisha's infrastructure sector. From roads to buildings, his company contributed to the development of Sambalpur and beyond.</p>
                        <h3>Success and Legacy</h3>
                        <p>Today, Maa Jhadeswari Constructions stands as a testament to Adikanda Sith's journey from zero to a successful entrepreneur. His story is an inspiration to every struggling individual, proving that with patience, persistence, and a never-give-up attitude, anyone can transform their fate.</p>
                        <p>From a cycle store owner to a construction magnate, his journey reflects the power of resilience and ambition. His life teaches us that success is not about where you start, but how far you are willing to go.</p>
